# Sh1ttybr0ker
[friendly explanation] Unenrollment through **br0ker** + **sh1ttyoobe** on low versions (tested on 126), does NOT work on 132 
device specifications below >>>
__if you don't already have a sd card with **Aurora** on it:__
1. obtain usb/sd card and flash [aurora](https://github.com/AerialiteLabs/Aurora) on it using any etcher such as chromebook recovery utils, balenaetcher, rufus, etc(aurora since it has like legacy sh1mmer built in and skids like you and me are too stupid to be able to build legacy shims)
2.  Make sure the sd drive has sh1mmer legacy installed. (You can do this [connecting to wifi], going to download a shim > sh1mmer legacy > and downloading it. Then you can run the shim. 
__How to do the exploit once you have the sd card/usb with aurora and sh1mmer legacy installed:__
1. boot aurora [connect to wifi if you're not connected]
2. boot sh1mmer legacy
3. press p to go to payloads
4. run br0ker
5. it should say its rebooting. That's good
6. Now when it boots we can do Sh1ttyoobe. (press quick setup with android phone [you dont need one], press control + alt + shift + r, then press cancel)
7. you can now sign in with your personal email
8. if it prompts you to update wait 10 seconds and there should be a "skip for now" option in the bottom right corner
9. profit. you are now sh1ttyoobed, or I should say, "sh1ttybr0kered"
